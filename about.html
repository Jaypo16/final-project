By delivering precise passes to your teammates, you exploit gaps in the defense, leaving opponents scrambling to recover. Your teammates will have more open shots and better chances to score, making your team a formidable force on offense. Some of the best playmakers include Steve Nash and Magic Johnson.</p>
